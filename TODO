* Right now the data mapper allows a different account key to be passed based on either the username or the IP
* This may need to be a different parameter such as an account code to allow more flexibility but this would make the
submitter and the NFO collector service more complex

* At the moment resubmissions won't work in multi mode

* We need to enable SSL
* Once the NFO Collector API can receive pre-parsed data we will need to change the Chunk::dump method to handle LogLine objects not just strings
